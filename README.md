A pure HTML/JS/CSS 2d game engine.

This README file is temporary and a better looking one will probably be
made at some point in the future.
The following information is probably important:

- The engine is very young and, in its current state, is only meant to be **effective**, but not
neccesarily **efficient**.
- Currently, there is no documentation on how to use the engine. It will probably be made in the near future.
If you want to dig through the uncommentated code and try to figure out how it works, good luck.
- The engine uses HTML's elements as the game objects and sprites. It does not use *canvas*
- The engine can only display 2D images, and they must be provided in a tileset. The future
documentation will most likely call this tileset an *Atlas*.
-The engine uses the HTML *audio* tag for audio capabilities.

The engine was originally made for a game design course I took in 2018. The engine worked as expected, but it was never used for anything beyond that.

The game that was made using the engine can be found here.

I apologize in advance for the underwhelming gameplay.
